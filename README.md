## üì± What is this?

Start On Farcaster is a Mini App that guides users through a step-by-step process to create a good looking Farcaster account, post engaging content, and connect with the community. It's based on a 7-day challenge created by [Kate Kornish](https://warpcast.com/katekornish) to help users get rid of the spam label and build a meaningful presence on Farcaster.
